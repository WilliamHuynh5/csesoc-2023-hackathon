## Task

### 1.1. Introduction

Post-COVID, our world has opened its arm once more to travelling: to embrace the thrills, uncertainties, and adventures of exploring a distant place. We are presented with endless possibilities to broaden our horizons and connect with a diverse range of communities.

But amid the excitement of travelling, we find challenges too. From cancelled flights to realising your accommodation was catfishing you, and everything in between, there are no limits to the problems you can solve.

So, what are you waiting for?

### 1.2.Task

Create a technical solution to address problems or provide utility for personal travel (e.g. Commuting, Holidays)

### 1.3. Examples of projects

- Public transport alert (train ticket inspector warning)
- Find free parking near hotels/AirBnB (extensions for booking sites)
- Sky colour predictor for sunset/sunrise
